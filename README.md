Click anywhere on the screen to advance from the initial logo splashcreen.

1. My game has the following three scenes:

4. I did most of my shape design in adobe illustrator, but used geometric shapes a bit:
-lines for the menu bar in Scence C
-lines arund logo + start button

5. The logo in the menu screen is created in adobe illustrator

6. There is a multi-line text block in the menu scence (Scene B)
